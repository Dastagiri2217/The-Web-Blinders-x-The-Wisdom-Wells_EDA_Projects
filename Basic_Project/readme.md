# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the data, uncover patterns, and derive insights that may help understand the factors affecting passenger survival.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Understand the structure and content of the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing data appropriately
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualize relationships using charts and plots
- Generate insights about survival rates based on various features

---

## 🔎 Questions Explored

1. **How many passengers survived vs. died?**
2. **Which gender survived more?**
3. **Are passengers with small families more likely to survive?**
4. **Does a passenger's title (like Mr, Mrs, Miss) affect survival?**
5. **Were passengers in higher classes (like 1st class) more likely to survive than those in lower classes?**

## 📌 Dataset Description

The dataset contains data about Titanic passengers, including:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name, Sex, Age**
- **SibSp**: # of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: # of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket, Fare, Cabin**
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 📍 EDA Highlights

- Checked for missing values and handled them
- Visualized distributions of age, fare, and other features
- Compared survival rates across gender, class, and age groups
- Created new features such as family size and extracted titles from names
- Identified patterns in survival based on passenger class, title, and family size
